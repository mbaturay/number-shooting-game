# Number Shooter

A retro-inspired web game where you intercept falling numbers by matching and shooting them before they reach the bottom!

## How to Play

- Use **J** to increase and **D** to decrease your selected number (1-9).
- Press **Space** to shoot. If your selected number matches a falling number, it is destroyed and you score a point.
- Each missed number costs you a life. You start with 5 lives.
- Every 5 successful hits increases the level (up to 10), making numbers fall faster and spawn more frequently.
- The game ends when you lose all your lives. Click **Play Again** to restart!

## Features

- Score and lives tracking
- Retro visuals and level-up messages
