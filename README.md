# Number Shooter

A retro-inspired web game where you intercept falling numbers by matching and shooting them before they reach the bottom!

## How to Play

- Use **J** to increase and **D** to decrease your selected number (1-9).
- Press **Space** to shoot. If your selected number matches a falling number, it is destroyed and you score a point.
- On touch devices, use the **+** and **-** buttons to change your number and the **Fire** button to shoot.
- Each missed number costs you a life. You start with 3 lives.
- Every 5 successful hits increases the level (up to 10), making numbers fall faster and spawn more frequently.
- The game ends when you lose all your lives. Click **Play Again** to restart!
- Your high score is saved automatically.

## Features

- 10 levels with increasing speed and spawn rate
